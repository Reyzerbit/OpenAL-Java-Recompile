# OpenAL Java Recompile

This is a recompile of the Open Audio Library or OpenAL for Java! I originally got the code from someone names [Urish](https://github.com/urish) on Github right [here.](https://github.com/urish/java-openal)

It also uses the [Java Native Access](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) as a library.

I give credit to both users, I just recompiled it and distributed it as a JAR file to use as a library, specifically in [Eclipse.](https://eclipse.org/)

Please enjoy and use to your own liking!
